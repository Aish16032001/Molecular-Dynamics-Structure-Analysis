# Molecular-Dynamics-Structure-Analysis

# Introduction: 
Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in computational materials research can produce large data sets with hundreds of frames. Converging difficult structures and researching material attributes require the analysis of these frames in order to extract useful information, such as particular bond lengths or atomic locations. However, manually sorting through MD datasets can be a laborious and error-prone procedure. In order to overcome these obstacles, I have created a Python script that improves and automates MD frame analysis by utilizing the pymatgen module.
